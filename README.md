**Grade Calculator Web Application**

The Grade Calculator is a web-based application designed to help users input their semester grades, calculate their average, and receive a letter grade based on standard grading criteria. The application also stores previous results and suggests career options based on the calculated grade. Built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, the app ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience. To run the application locally, clone the repository from GitHub, navigate to the project directory, install dependencies with `npm install`, and start the development server using `npm start`. If deploying to Render.com, ensure the build command is `npm install && npm run build` and the start command is `serve -s build` to properly serve the production version. The application saves user data in `localStorage`, enabling persistence across sessions, and offers an intuitive UI for seamless interaction.
